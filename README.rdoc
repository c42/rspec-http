= RSpec HTTP 0.11.0

RSpec HTTP is a RSpec extension library that adds support for writing specs that cover HTTP based APIs (or more popularly, RESTful APIs). 

To use this library, first add the rspec-http gem to your Gemfile like so:
  gem 'rspec-http'

Then add the following line to your spec_helper.rb:
  require 'rspec/http'
  
This will make matchers such as the ones listed below available to you in your specs.
  
  expect(response).to be_http_ok
  
  expect(response).to be_http_created
  
  expect(response).to be_http_unprocessable_entity
  
  expect(response).to be_http_im_a_teapot
  
  expect(response).to have_header('Content-Type')

  expect(response).to have_header('Content-Type' => 'application/json')
  
  expect(response).to have_header('Content-Type' => /json/)

== Rails

If you're using Rails (and implicitly, rspec-rails), the same http code matchers will also be available in your controller specs *without* the <code>http</code> namespace.

In other words, in your controller specs you can do:

  expect(response).to be_ok

  expect(response).to be_created

  expect(response).to be_unprocessable_entity

  expect(response).to be_im_a_teapot
